	<h2>My Experience</h2>
	<p>May 2022, I was not in the best place.</p>
	<p>I was going through a difficult time in my life, and my experesion and actions would show it throughout the day.</p>
	<p>I would barely talk to anyone, and keep to myself.</p>
	<p>My friends didn't know what was going on at the time, but every day they would go out of their way to ask me how I was doing, even if they weren't sure of why i was acting the way I was.</p>
	<p>A simple gesture of kindness like this brighteted up this period of my life immensely.
