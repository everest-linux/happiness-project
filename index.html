	<h2>Welcome to my Theology project.</h2>
	<p>As you see, I did a website again. this is my favorite way of conveying information to people.</p>
	<p>Some notable improvements from the last website:</p>
	<p>- This one looks the best (mainly because I modeled it off of my main website, https://www.everestlinux.org).</p>
	<p>- I actually used JavaScript this time, you can see it in the Virtues and Vices page.</p>
	<p>In case you want to see the website's source code, it's over at https://github.com/everest-linux/happiness-project. I left a secret message in one of the source code files, see if you can find it.</p>
