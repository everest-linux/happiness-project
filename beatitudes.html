	<h2>The Beatitudes</h2>
	<p>The Beatitudes were given to us by Jesus at the sermon on the mount to show us the way to happiness.</p>
	<p>Using The Beatitudes, we can live our lives with true happiness.</p>
	<p>Blessed means happy.</p>
	<p><strong>I. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven</strong></p>
	<p>People who are "poor in spirit" are totally dependent on God and totally detached spiritually from possessions.</p>
	<p><strong>II. Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted</strong></p>
	<p>Go to God when you're suffering. God promises that our sorrow will be turned to joy. People who are moruning have God by their side.</p>
	<p><strong>III. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth</strong></p>
	<p>Meekness is humility, in other words, putting others before yourself, and not being prideful.</p>
	<p><strong>IV. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</strong></p>
	<p>People who hunger and thirst for righteousness desire to do the right thing, and desire the good for others and themselves.</p>
	<p><strong>V. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy</strong></p>
	<p>Those who show mercy towards others are shown mercy by God. Being merciful includes not holding grudges, even towards those who have wronged us.</p>
	<p><strong>VI. Blessed are the pure of heart, for they shall see God</strong></p>
	<p>Purity of heart means seeing the world with the heart and mind of God, seeing Christ through everything, and showing purity through our actions.</p>
	<p><strong>VII. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God</strong></p>
	<p>As we are all God's children, we are called to seek peace with one another, and to unite, rather than divide. Jesus promises peace, and those who follow Him will spread it.</p>
	<p><strong>VIII. Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven</strong></p>
	<p>Those who suffer because of their faith in Christ will be rewarded in Heaven. Since we are transformed by Christ, we may transform the world.</p>
